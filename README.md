# InsideBar_Strategy

This project demonstrates a framework for backtesting and visualizing the Inside Bar Strategy on cryptocurrency price data using Python. The script processes historical price data (e.g., BTC/USD 4-hour timeframe), applies the Inside Bar Strategy (logic masked for proprietary reasons), and generates insightful visualizations to evaluate performance.

## Results
